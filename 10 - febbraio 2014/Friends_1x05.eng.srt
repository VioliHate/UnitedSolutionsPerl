00:00:02,871 --> 00:00:04,941
WouId you Iet it go?
It's not a big deaI.

2
00:00:05,191 --> 00:00:06,863
Not a big deaI?
It's amazing.

3
00:00:07,111 --> 00:00:09,864
You reach in, there's one
IittIe maneuver, and bam!

4
00:00:10,071 --> 00:00:12,187
A bra. Right out the sIeeve.

5
00:00:12,591 --> 00:00:13,865
As far as I'm concerned. . .

6
00:00:14,111 --> 00:00:17,228
. . .there is nothing a guy can do
that comes cIose. Right?

7
00:00:17,471 --> 00:00:18,301
Come on!

8
00:00:18,551 --> 00:00:20,303
You guys can pee standing up.

9
00:00:20,551 --> 00:00:22,667
We can? Okay, I'm trying that.

10
00:00:24,391 --> 00:00:25,870
You know what bIows my mind?

11
00:00:26,071 --> 00:00:29,188
Women can see breasts
anytime they want.

12
00:00:31,311 --> 00:00:33,381
You just Iook down,
and there they are.

13
00:00:33,591 --> 00:00:36,025
How you get any work done
is beyond me.

14
00:00:37,471 --> 00:00:40,827
What I don't get is the way
guys can do so many mean things. . .

15
00:00:41,031 --> 00:00:42,384
. . .and then not even care.

Saturday night. The big night!

21
00:01:46,431 --> 00:01:49,423
Date night!
Saturday night. Saturday night!

22
00:01:51,431 --> 00:01:53,626
-No pIans, huh?
-Not a one!

23
00:01:54,711 --> 00:01:56,542
Not even breaking up
with Janice?

24
00:01:56,791 --> 00:01:58,941
Right, right. Shut up.

25
00:02:00,711 --> 00:02:03,384
ChandIer, nobody Iikes
breaking up with someone.

26
00:02:03,671 --> 00:02:07,061
-You just gotta do it.
-I know. But it's just so hard.

27
00:02:07,311 --> 00:02:10,144
You're sitting with her.
She has no idea what's happening.

28
00:02:10,391 --> 00:02:12,746
You finaIIy get up
the courage to do it.

29
00:02:12,991 --> 00:02:16,142
There's that awkward moment
when you've handed her the note.

30
00:02:19,711 --> 00:02:21,861
Why do you have to break up with her?

31
00:02:22,071 --> 00:02:24,585
Be a man. Just stop caIIing.

32
00:02:27,071 --> 00:02:28,948
If you want, I'II do it with you.

33
00:02:29,471 --> 00:02:32,668
Thanks, but she'd feeI Iike
we were ganging up on her.

34
00:02:32,911 --> 00:02:35,425
You break up with Janice.
I'II break up with Tony.

35
00:02:35,671 --> 00:02:37,024
You're breaking up with Tony?

36
00:02:37,271 --> 00:02:39,831
He's sweet, but it's just
not fun anymore.

37
00:02:40,071 --> 00:02:43,222
I don't know if it's me or
his hunger strike. I don't know.

38
00:02:45,511 --> 00:02:46,944
Do you want anything eIse?

39
00:02:47,191 --> 00:02:51,503
You had a nutty, chocoIate-y,
kind of cake-y, pie thing that--

40
00:02:53,031 --> 00:02:54,544
Nothing. I'm fine.

41
00:02:57,071 --> 00:02:58,948
What's the matter?
Why so scrunchie?

42
00:02:59,551 --> 00:03:02,463
My father wants to give me
a Mercedes convertibIe.

43
00:03:03,511 --> 00:03:06,423
That guy, he burns me up.

44
00:03:06,951 --> 00:03:09,863
Yeah, weII, it's a Mercedes
if I move back home.

45
00:03:10,111 --> 00:03:12,909
It was horribIe!
He caIIed me " young Iady. "

46
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:15,426
I hate when my father
caIIs me that.

47
00:03:16,511 --> 00:03:19,628
Did he give you that
"You're not up to this" thing again?

48
00:03:19,831 --> 00:03:22,709
I got the extended disco
version with choruses of. . .

49
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:24,708
. . . " You'II Never Make it on Your Own. "

50
00:03:29,591 --> 00:03:31,024
Hi, Joey.

51
00:03:32,231 --> 00:03:33,346
Oh, my God! AngeIa!

52
00:03:33,551 --> 00:03:36,623
Wow! Being dumped by you
obviousIy agrees with her.

53
00:03:36,871 --> 00:03:38,668
-Are you gonna go over there?
-No.

54
00:03:39,431 --> 00:03:40,864
Yeah. No.

55
00:03:42,031 --> 00:03:44,829
Okay, but not yet.
I don't wanna seem too eager.

56
00:03:47,711 --> 00:03:50,225
One Mississippi, two Mississippi. . .

57
00:03:50,631 --> 00:03:52,587
. . .three Mississippi.
That seems cooI.

58
00:03:56,791 --> 00:03:58,019
Hey, AngeIa.

59
00:03:59,471 --> 00:04:00,620
You Iook good.

60
00:04:01,111 --> 00:04:04,023
Because I'm wearing a dress
that accents my boobs.

61
00:04:11,271 --> 00:04:12,386
You don't say.

62
00:04:14,191 --> 00:04:16,659
So, RacheI, what are you
doing tonight?

63
00:04:16,911 --> 00:04:20,221
Big gIamour night.
Me and Monica at Launderama.

64
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:25,022
You wanna hear a freakish coincidence?

65
00:04:25,231 --> 00:04:26,983
Guess who's doing Iaundry there too?

66
00:04:27,711 --> 00:04:29,064
-Who?
-Me!

67
00:04:29,831 --> 00:04:31,583
Was that not cIear?

68
00:04:34,831 --> 00:04:36,059
Why don't. . . .

69
00:04:36,271 --> 00:04:39,263
Why don't I just
join you both there?

70
00:04:39,471 --> 00:04:41,826
Don't you have a Iaundry room
in your buiIding?

71
00:04:45,711 --> 00:04:48,430
I do have a Iaundry room
in my buiIding.

72
00:04:51,311 --> 00:04:52,949
But there's a rat probIem.

73
00:04:53,191 --> 00:04:56,263
ApparentIy, they're attracted to
the dryer sheets.

74
00:04:56,471 --> 00:04:59,224
They're going in fine,
but they're coming out aII. . .

75
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:00,941
. . .fIuffy.

76
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:04,860
Anyway, 7-ish?

77
00:05:05,311 --> 00:05:06,187
Sure.

78
00:05:09,231 --> 00:05:11,222
Forget it, Joey.
I'm with Bob now.

79
00:05:11,431 --> 00:05:13,661
Bob? Who the heII's Bob?

80
00:05:13,911 --> 00:05:15,230
Bob is great.

81
00:05:15,431 --> 00:05:18,468
He's smart, sophisticated,
and he has a reaI job.

82
00:05:18,711 --> 00:05:22,465
You go on three auditions a month
and caII yourseIf an actor. But Bob--

83
00:05:22,671 --> 00:05:25,583
Come on! We were great together.

84
00:05:25,831 --> 00:05:30,029
And not just at the fun stuff,
but, Iike, taIking too.

85
00:05:33,271 --> 00:05:35,944
Sorry, Joey. You said,
"Let's just be friends. "

86
00:05:36,191 --> 00:05:37,590
So guess what?

87
00:05:37,791 --> 00:05:39,827
-What?
-We're just friends.

88
00:05:40,311 --> 00:05:41,664
Fine. Fine.

89
00:05:41,911 --> 00:05:45,506
Why don't the four of us have
dinner tonight? You know, as friends.

90
00:05:45,751 --> 00:05:47,025
What " four of us" ?

91
00:05:47,271 --> 00:05:50,581
You and Bob,
and me and my girIfriend. . .

92
00:05:52,471 --> 00:05:53,267
. . .Monica.

93
00:05:53,471 --> 00:05:56,269
I'm teIIing you, this guy
is perfect for you.

94
00:05:56,471 --> 00:06:00,100
Forget it! Not after your cousin
who couId beIch the aIphabet.

95
00:06:00,991 --> 00:06:04,666
Come on, this guy's great.
His name's Bob. He's AngeIa's. . .

96
00:06:04,911 --> 00:06:05,980
. . .brother.

97
00:06:06,191 --> 00:06:08,147
He's smart, he's sophisticated. . .

98
00:06:08,391 --> 00:06:10,063
. . .and he has a reaI job.

99
00:06:10,311 --> 00:06:14,065
I go on three auditions a month
and caII myseIf an actor, but Bob is--

100
00:06:14,311 --> 00:06:15,824
-Oh, God heIp us.
-What?

101
00:06:16,031 --> 00:06:18,465
UgIy Naked Guy is Iaying kitchen tiIe.

102
00:06:22,031 --> 00:06:24,420
Look, I'm asking a favor here.

103
00:06:24,631 --> 00:06:27,020
I'm thinking if I do this
for her brother. . .

104
00:06:27,271 --> 00:06:29,023
. . .maybe AngeIa wiII come back to me.

105
00:06:29,271 --> 00:06:32,422
What's going on here?
You go out with tons of girIs.

106
00:06:32,631 --> 00:06:34,030
I know, but. . . .

107
00:06:35,911 --> 00:06:40,223
Look, I made a huge mistake.
I never shouId've broke up with her.

108
00:06:40,431 --> 00:06:42,661
WiII you heIp me? PIease?

109
00:06:51,431 --> 00:06:54,867
Monica's not coming.
It's just gonna be me and RacheI.

110
00:06:56,191 --> 00:06:59,149
HoId on there, camper.
You've thought this through?

111
00:06:59,391 --> 00:07:02,428
It's Iaundry. The thinking
through is pretty minimaI.

112
00:07:03,511 --> 00:07:05,547
Just you and RacheI?
Just the two of you?

113
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:07,941
This is a date.
You're going on a date.

114
00:07:15,311 --> 00:07:16,426
What are you saying?

115
00:07:16,671 --> 00:07:18,980
I shouId shave again?
Pick up some wine?

116
00:07:19,231 --> 00:07:22,428
WeII, you may wanna rethink
the dirty underwear.

117
00:07:23,671 --> 00:07:27,630
It's the first time she'II see your
underwear. You want it to be dirty?

118
00:07:34,431 --> 00:07:36,501
And the fabric softener?

119
00:07:37,311 --> 00:07:39,381
Now, what is wrong with my SnuggIes?

120
00:07:40,911 --> 00:07:44,426
What? It says I'm a sensitive,
warm kind of guy.

121
00:07:44,671 --> 00:07:47,026
You know, Iike a IittIe fuzzy bear.

122
00:07:49,111 --> 00:07:51,420
I can pick something eIse
up on the way.

123
00:07:56,071 --> 00:07:56,867
Thank you.

124
00:07:57,071 --> 00:08:00,188
So what does this Bob guy
Iook Iike? Is he taII, short?

125
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:02,224
Yep.

126
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:03,987
Which?

127
00:08:04,431 --> 00:08:05,625
Which what?

128
00:08:07,071 --> 00:08:09,107
You've never met Bob, have you?

129
00:08:09,511 --> 00:08:10,341
No, but--

130
00:08:10,591 --> 00:08:12,866
For aII we know,
he couId be horribIy--

131
00:08:14,871 --> 00:08:18,022
HorribIy attractive.
I'II be shutting up now.

132
00:08:22,871 --> 00:08:25,021
Where are they? Where are they?

133
00:08:25,231 --> 00:08:28,428
This is nice. We never
do anything, just the two of us.

134
00:08:29,031 --> 00:08:33,024
That's great. Maybe tomorrow we can
rent a car, run over some puppies.

135
00:08:33,511 --> 00:08:34,705
I don't wanna do that.

136
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:39,990
-Here we go.
-Have a good breakup.

137
00:08:41,671 --> 00:08:45,141
-Hey, Janice.
-My God, I am so gIad you caIIed me.

138
00:08:45,351 --> 00:08:48,468
I had the most supremeIy awfuI day.

139
00:08:49,711 --> 00:08:50,985
That's not good.

140
00:08:52,391 --> 00:08:55,224
Can I get an espresso
and a Iatte over here, pIease?

141
00:08:55,471 --> 00:08:58,269
We got the proofs from that
photo shoot with the vegetabIes.

142
00:08:58,511 --> 00:08:59,466
They sucked.

143
00:08:59,711 --> 00:09:02,589
I bIew off the rest of the afternoon.
I went shopping.

144
00:09:02,831 --> 00:09:05,629
And I got you. . . .

145
00:09:05,871 --> 00:09:08,704
I'm Iooking. I'm Iooking.

146
00:09:09,111 --> 00:09:11,147
I'm Iooking.

147
00:09:11,831 --> 00:09:13,059
-I got you--
-What?

148
00:09:13,271 --> 00:09:16,820
-What?
-What did you get me there?

149
00:09:17,111 --> 00:09:19,420
I got you. . .

150
00:09:19,911 --> 00:09:21,230
. . .these.

151
00:09:22,031 --> 00:09:23,862
BuIIwinkIe socks.

152
00:09:24,111 --> 00:09:26,386
-That's so sweet.
-I knew you had the Rockys.

153
00:09:26,631 --> 00:09:28,622
So you couId wear
BuIIwinkIe and BuIIwinkIe. . .

154
00:09:28,871 --> 00:09:31,829
. . .or wear Rocky and Rocky,
or you can mix and match.

155
00:09:32,031 --> 00:09:33,828
Moose and squirreI.

156
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:35,828
Whatever you want.

157
00:09:39,711 --> 00:09:42,271
I'm gonna get another espresso.
More Iatte?

158
00:09:45,271 --> 00:09:48,229
No, I'm stiII working on mine.

159
00:09:52,871 --> 00:09:53,667
That's it?

160
00:09:53,911 --> 00:09:55,264
Yeah, it was reaIIy hard.

161
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:57,542
The hug Iooked pretty brutaI.

162
00:09:58,191 --> 00:09:59,419
You weren't there.

163
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:14,021
Coming through! Move! Move!

164
00:10:19,031 --> 00:10:22,262
Excuse me! I was kind of
using that machine.

165
00:10:22,511 --> 00:10:24,820
Yeah, weII, now you're kind of not.

166
00:10:25,991 --> 00:10:28,744
But I saved it.
I put my basket on top.

167
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:31,346
I'm sorry.
Is that your basket?

168
00:10:31,591 --> 00:10:34,469
It's reaIIy pretty.
UnfortunateIy, I don't see suds!

169
00:10:36,911 --> 00:10:37,866
What?

170
00:10:39,031 --> 00:10:42,068
No suds, no save, okay?

171
00:10:44,831 --> 00:10:46,230
What's going on?

172
00:10:46,431 --> 00:10:50,026
Nothing. This horribIe woman
just took my machine.

173
00:10:50,311 --> 00:10:51,710
Was your basket on top?

174
00:10:51,951 --> 00:10:54,067
-Yeah, but there were no suds.
-So?

175
00:10:54,311 --> 00:10:55,744
You know, no suds, no save.

176
00:10:55,991 --> 00:10:57,868
No suds, no--
Excuse me.

177
00:10:58,111 --> 00:10:59,624
HoId on a second!

178
00:10:59,831 --> 00:11:01,901
This is my friend's machine.

179
00:11:02,151 --> 00:11:04,221
Hey, hey, hey!
Her stuff wasn't in it!

180
00:11:04,471 --> 00:11:08,305
Hey, hey, hey! That's not
the ruIe, and you know it!

181
00:11:18,391 --> 00:11:19,870
AII right. Show's over.

182
00:11:22,711 --> 00:11:24,827
Nothing to see here.

183
00:11:27,911 --> 00:11:29,230
Let's do Iaundry.

184
00:11:29,431 --> 00:11:33,060
That was amazing!
I can't even send back soup.

185
00:11:33,311 --> 00:11:37,623
WeII, that's because you're
such a sweet, gentIe. . . .

186
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:43,588
You must need detergent.

187
00:11:47,391 --> 00:11:49,268
-What's that?
-Uberweiss.

188
00:11:50,191 --> 00:11:53,183
It's new. It's German.
It's extra tough!

189
00:11:55,391 --> 00:11:57,302
Are you gonna separate those?

190
00:11:58,831 --> 00:12:00,230
Oh, God.

191
00:12:00,991 --> 00:12:03,266
Am I being Iike a totaI Iaundry spaz?

192
00:12:03,511 --> 00:12:07,186
Am I supposed to use one machine
for shirts and another for pants?

193
00:12:11,511 --> 00:12:13,547
Have you never done this before?

194
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:16,783
WeII, not myseIf.
But I know other peopIe that have.

195
00:12:18,511 --> 00:12:21,423
Okay. You caught me.
I'm a Iaundry virgin.

196
00:12:23,031 --> 00:12:25,989
Don't worry.
I'II use the gentIe cycIe.

197
00:12:30,511 --> 00:12:34,140
BasicaIIy, you wanna use
one machine for aII your whites.

198
00:12:35,311 --> 00:12:37,461
A whoIe other machine
for your coIors.

199
00:12:37,711 --> 00:12:40,430
And a third for your. . .

200
00:12:42,311 --> 00:12:44,871
. . .deIicates.
And that wouId be your bras. . .

201
00:12:45,111 --> 00:12:48,228
. . .and your underpanty things.

202
00:12:51,111 --> 00:12:53,227
These are white cotton panties.

203
00:12:53,431 --> 00:12:55,820
WouId they go with whites
or with deIicates?

204
00:12:56,431 --> 00:12:58,422
That wouId be a judgment caII.

205
00:13:03,391 --> 00:13:05,109
He's so cute!

206
00:13:06,951 --> 00:13:08,589
So where did you guys grow up?

207
00:13:08,831 --> 00:13:10,822
-BrookIyn Heights.
-CIeveIand.

208
00:13:12,391 --> 00:13:14,109
-How did that happen?
-Oh, my God!

209
00:13:14,471 --> 00:13:15,824
What?

210
00:13:16,311 --> 00:13:18,461
I suddenIy had the feeIing I was. . .

211
00:13:18,711 --> 00:13:20,224
. . .faIIing.

212
00:13:21,591 --> 00:13:22,501
But I'm not.

213
00:13:32,591 --> 00:13:34,661
So, you and AngeIa, huh?

214
00:13:34,911 --> 00:13:37,027
Yep. Pretty much.

215
00:13:37,431 --> 00:13:38,830
You're a Iucky man.

216
00:13:39,911 --> 00:13:41,867
You know what I miss
the most about her?

217
00:13:42,111 --> 00:13:45,228
That cute nibbIey noise
she makes when she eats.

218
00:13:45,431 --> 00:13:48,389
Like a happy IittIe squirreI. . .

219
00:13:49,031 --> 00:13:50,623
. . .or a weaseI.

220
00:13:51,991 --> 00:13:53,344
I never reaIIy noticed.

221
00:13:53,551 --> 00:13:55,860
Oh, yeah, yeah. Listen for it.

222
00:13:56,711 --> 00:13:58,622
Monica. Monica is great.

223
00:13:58,871 --> 00:14:01,021
Yeah, she is.

224
00:14:01,271 --> 00:14:03,341
But it's not gonna Iast.

225
00:14:04,991 --> 00:14:07,221
She's too much for me in bed.

226
00:14:08,391 --> 00:14:09,346
SexuaIIy.

227
00:14:12,911 --> 00:14:15,664
I've gotta teII you, Bob is terrific.

228
00:14:15,911 --> 00:14:17,139
Yeah, isn't he?

229
00:14:17,391 --> 00:14:20,144
It's so great to meet a guy
who's smart and funny. . .

230
00:14:20,391 --> 00:14:22,621
. . .and has an emotionaI age beyond 8.

231
00:14:22,871 --> 00:14:26,227
You know what eIse?
He's unbeIievabIe in bed!

232
00:14:30,231 --> 00:14:33,143
My brother never even toId me
when he Iost his virginity.

233
00:14:36,191 --> 00:14:37,385
That's nice.

234
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:45,264
You can do this. It's Iike
puIIing off a Band-Aid.

235
00:14:45,511 --> 00:14:49,345
Just do it reaIIy fast,
and then the wound is exposed.

236
00:14:49,591 --> 00:14:51,024
Go! Go!

237
00:15:03,431 --> 00:15:04,500
Hi, Janice.

238
00:15:05,991 --> 00:15:08,266
I don't think we shouId
go out anymore.

239
00:15:16,511 --> 00:15:17,830
AII right.

240
00:15:22,311 --> 00:15:24,029
WeII, there you go.

241
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:26,349
Stop it, stop it, stop it.

242
00:15:30,791 --> 00:15:33,828
I know this is gonna sound
reaIIy stupid. . .

243
00:15:34,071 --> 00:15:36,221
. . .but I feeI that if I can do this. . .

244
00:15:36,471 --> 00:15:39,224
. . .if I can actuaIIy do
my own Iaundry. . .

245
00:15:39,431 --> 00:15:41,228
. . .there isn't anything I can't do.

246
00:15:42,151 --> 00:15:44,426
That does not sound stupid to me.

247
00:15:45,591 --> 00:15:49,584
The first time I had to make dinner
for myseIf after CaroI Ieft me. . . .

248
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:53,625
I'm sorry, that's aII the time
we have. Next on Ross. . . .

249
00:15:55,231 --> 00:15:56,505
-Uh-oh.
-What, " uh-oh" ?

250
00:15:56,751 --> 00:15:57,820
Uh-oh. . . .

251
00:15:58,031 --> 00:16:00,829
Uh-oh, the Iaundry's done.

252
00:16:02,271 --> 00:16:03,863
It's a song.

253
00:16:04,111 --> 00:16:05,863
The Iaundry song that we sing.

254
00:16:06,871 --> 00:16:10,068
Uh-oh! The laundry's done

255
00:16:11,031 --> 00:16:11,861
What's the matter?

256
00:16:12,111 --> 00:16:13,146
Nothing. Nothing.

257
00:16:13,391 --> 00:16:14,665
The laundry's done

258
00:16:14,911 --> 00:16:15,946
Come on, show me.

259
00:16:16,191 --> 00:16:20,104
It's just that you Ieft a red sock
in with your whites, and now. . .

260
00:16:22,711 --> 00:16:24,827
. . .everything's kind of pink.

261
00:16:26,231 --> 00:16:27,550
Everything's pink?

262
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:30,430
Except for the red sock,
which is stiII red.

263
00:16:30,871 --> 00:16:33,260
Don't be upset.
It can happen to anyone.

264
00:16:33,511 --> 00:16:35,308
But it didn't.
It happened to me.

265
00:16:35,551 --> 00:16:38,987
God, I'm gonna Iook Iike
a big MarshmaIIow Peep!

266
00:16:39,191 --> 00:16:40,943
What am I doing? What am I doing?

267
00:16:41,191 --> 00:16:44,228
My father's right!
I can't Iive on my own.

268
00:16:44,431 --> 00:16:46,820
I can't even do Iaundry!

269
00:16:57,871 --> 00:16:59,668
Something went wrong
with Underdog. . .

270
00:16:59,911 --> 00:17:02,027
. . .and they couIdn't get
his head to infIate.

271
00:17:03,311 --> 00:17:04,824
So anyway. . .

272
00:17:06,031 --> 00:17:08,704
. . .his head is, Iike,
fIopping down Broadway.

273
00:17:09,791 --> 00:17:10,826
And I'm thinking. . .

274
00:17:11,991 --> 00:17:14,630
. . .how inappropriate this is.

275
00:17:14,991 --> 00:17:18,825
Something's in my eye. CouId we
check it in the Iight, pIease?

276
00:17:22,031 --> 00:17:23,384
-Oh, my God!
-What?

277
00:17:23,631 --> 00:17:26,225
HeIIo! Were we at
the same tabIe? It's Iike. . .

278
00:17:26,431 --> 00:17:28,626
. . .cocktaiIs in AppaIachia.

279
00:17:32,951 --> 00:17:33,747
They're cIose.

280
00:17:33,991 --> 00:17:36,949
CIose? She's got her
tongue in his ear.

281
00:17:37,711 --> 00:17:41,545
Like you've never got a IittIe
rambunctious with Ross.

282
00:17:42,711 --> 00:17:46,260
Joey, this is sick.
It's disgusting. It's. . .

283
00:17:47,071 --> 00:17:48,663
. . .not reaIIy true, is it?

284
00:17:48,911 --> 00:17:50,503
Who's to say what's true?

285
00:17:50,751 --> 00:17:51,786
What were you thinking?

286
00:17:52,031 --> 00:17:54,465
I'm not proud of this, okay?

287
00:17:54,711 --> 00:17:56,064
Maybe I am a IittIe.

288
00:17:58,071 --> 00:17:59,868
-I'm out of here!
-Wait! Come on!

289
00:18:00,071 --> 00:18:01,868
You Iike him. I want her.

290
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:03,464
He Iikes you.

291
00:18:04,231 --> 00:18:05,027
ReaIIy?

292
00:18:06,271 --> 00:18:09,820
I'm thinking, if we put our heads
together, between the two of us. . .

293
00:18:10,031 --> 00:18:12,022
. . .we can break them up.

294
00:18:14,751 --> 00:18:17,060
I'm so sorry.
I can't beIieve I did this.

295
00:18:17,311 --> 00:18:20,621
I just couIdn't stop Iaughing
at your Norman MaiIer story.

296
00:18:26,711 --> 00:18:29,828
Waiter? One more pIate of
chicken wings over here.

297
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:38,146
Here's the thing.
It's Iike we're different.

298
00:18:38,391 --> 00:18:41,463
I'm the bing, bing, bing.
You're the boom, boom, boom.

299
00:18:41,711 --> 00:18:43,030
Oh, my God!

300
00:18:43,271 --> 00:18:44,147
I'm so sorry!

301
00:18:44,631 --> 00:18:45,950
Are you okay?

302
00:18:47,111 --> 00:18:49,067
It's just my Iens. It's my Iens.

303
00:18:49,831 --> 00:18:51,230
I'II be right back.

304
00:18:53,511 --> 00:18:55,741
I hit her in the eye!
I hit her in the eye!

305
00:18:55,991 --> 00:18:59,347
This is the worst breakup
in the history of the worId!

306
00:18:59,591 --> 00:19:01,263
Oh, my God!

307
00:19:03,311 --> 00:19:04,710
How many have you had?

308
00:19:04,951 --> 00:19:07,021
I don't know. A miIIion!

309
00:19:07,871 --> 00:19:10,988
ChandIer, easy, easy.
Go to your happy pIace.

310
00:19:14,391 --> 00:19:16,666
-I'm fine, I'm fine.
-AII right.

311
00:19:16,871 --> 00:19:18,623
I'm not fine. Here she comes.

312
00:19:18,831 --> 00:19:20,583
Wait here, okay? Breathe.

313
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:40,065
How do you do that?

314
00:19:40,311 --> 00:19:42,267
It's Iike a gift.

315
00:19:44,831 --> 00:19:47,061
We shouId aIways break up together.

316
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:48,380
I'd Iike that!

317
00:19:50,431 --> 00:19:53,423
You got the cIothes cIean.
That's the important part.

318
00:19:53,631 --> 00:19:56,862
I guess. Except everything
Iooks Iike jammies now.

319
00:20:02,711 --> 00:20:03,666
I'm sorry.

320
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:06,300
Excuse me. We had this cart.

321
00:20:06,991 --> 00:20:09,585
I had a 24-inch waist.
You Iose things.

322
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:11,986
Now, come on.
Get out of my way.

323
00:20:12,231 --> 00:20:15,701
I'm sorry. Maybe I wasn't
being cIear. This was our cart.

324
00:20:15,991 --> 00:20:17,868
There aren't any cIothes in it!

325
00:20:18,111 --> 00:20:20,579
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Quit making up ruIes!

326
00:20:20,831 --> 00:20:22,822
Let go! Come on, it's my cart.

327
00:20:24,311 --> 00:20:26,427
Listen, Mitzi, if you
want this cart. . .

328
00:20:26,631 --> 00:20:29,065
. . .you're gonna have to
take me with it!

329
00:20:36,071 --> 00:20:37,868
Yes! Did you see that?

330
00:20:38,111 --> 00:20:39,260
You were incredibIe.

331
00:20:39,471 --> 00:20:41,860
A brand-new woman,
Iadies and gentIemen.

332
00:20:42,071 --> 00:20:44,346
I couId not have
done this without you.

333
00:20:52,871 --> 00:20:54,623
More cIothes in the dryer?

334
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:58,827
-I'm fine. I'm fine.
-Are you sure?

335
00:21:03,031 --> 00:21:05,226
Are you sure you're okay?

336
00:21:05,511 --> 00:21:07,422
Does it stiII hurt?

337
00:21:09,951 --> 00:21:13,626
What a neat idea. AII your
cIothes match. I'm gonna do this.

338
00:21:16,511 --> 00:21:17,466
How'd it go?

339
00:21:17,711 --> 00:21:18,700
ExceIIent!

340
00:21:18,951 --> 00:21:23,024
We ripped that coupIe apart
and kept the pieces for ourseIves.

341
00:21:24,231 --> 00:21:25,505
What a beautifuI story.

342
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:29,105
I'm fine, by the way.

343
00:21:29,351 --> 00:21:30,625
I'm sorry.

344
00:21:31,111 --> 00:21:31,987
Where's ChandIer?

345
00:21:32,231 --> 00:21:33,903
He needed some time to grieve.

346
00:21:34,151 --> 00:21:36,301
I'm free! I'm free!

347
00:21:38,311 --> 00:21:39,824
That ought to do it.
