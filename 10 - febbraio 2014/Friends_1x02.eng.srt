1
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:04,299
You guys don't understand.

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:07,338
For us, kissing is as
important as any part of it.

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:08,973
Yeah, right!

4
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:12,649
You serious?

5
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:14,610
Oh, yeah!

6
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:17,095
AII you need to know
is in the first kiss.

7
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:18,136
AbsoIuteIy.

8
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:20,774
For us, kissing's an opening act. . .

9
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:23,972
. . .Iike the comedian
you have to sit through. . .

10
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:26,091
. . .before Pink FIoyd comes out.

11
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:32,332
And it's not that
we don't Iike the comedian.

12
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:34,735
It's just that that's not. . .

13
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:36,851
. . .why we bought the ticket.

14
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:43,298
The probIem is, after the concert,
no matter how great the show was. . .

15
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:46,896
. . .you girIs are aIways Iooking
for the comedian again.

16
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:50,098
We're in the car, fighting traffic. . .

17
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,779
. . .just trying to stay awake.

18
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:56,493
WeII, word of advice:
Bring back the comedian.

19
00:00:56,740 --> 00:01:01,177
Or next time you'II find yourseIf
Iistening to that aIbum aIone.

20
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:08,089
Are we stiII taIking about sex?

21
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,492

No, it's good.
It is good.

25
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:06,535
It's just that doesn't she seem
a IittIe angry?

26
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:08,332
WeII, she has issues.

27
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:11,299
Does she?

28
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:13,890
He's out banging other women
with a cIub. . .

29
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:17,615
. . .whiIe she's home getting
the mastodon smeII out of the carpet.

30
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:20,772
Marsha, see, these are cave peopIe.

31
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,896
Okay, they have issues Iike:

32
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:27,736
"Gee, that gIacier's
getting kind of cIose! " See?

33
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:30,500
Speaking of issues,
isn't that your ex-wife?

34
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:32,893
Yes, it is. CaroI, hi!

35
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:34,732
Okay. Yes, it is.

36
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:37,175
I'II catch up with you
in the Ice Age.

37
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:52,893
Hi.

38
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:00,856
So. . . .

39
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:03,699
You Iook great.

40
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:05,935
I hate that.

41
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:07,730
Sorry.

42
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:10,050
Thanks. You Iook good too.

43
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,689
WeII, you know,
in here, anyone who. . .

44
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:15,774
. . .stands erect. . . .

45
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:20,413
So what's new?
StiII a--

46
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:21,769
A Iesbian?

47
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,689
You never know.

48
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,171
How's the famiIy?

49
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:30,379
Marty's stiII totaIIy paranoid.

50
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,298
CaroI, why are you here?

51
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:34,976
I'm pregnant.

52
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,295
Pregnant!

53
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:47,329
She didn 't leave
in such a hurry after all.

54
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:52,091
This is the Three's Company episode
where's there's a misunderstanding.

55
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,891
Then I've aIready seen this one.

56
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,292
Are you through with that?

57
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:03,048
Sorry, the swaIIowing
sIowed me down.

58
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,218
Whose baII of paper is this?

59
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:10,055
That's mine. I wrote a note to
myseIf, then I didn't need it.

60
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:12,296
So I baIIed it up
and now I wish I was dead.

61
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:19,456
She aIready fIuffed that piIIow.
You aIready fIuffed-- It's fine.

62
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:23,416
I don't want to give them
any more ammunition than they have.

63
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:25,611
We know how crueI parents can be. . .

64
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:28,579
. . .about the fIatness
of a chiId's piIIow.

65
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:30,372
Monica? Hi!

66
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:34,369
Monica, you're scaring me.

67
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:38,931
I mean, you're aII chaotic
and twirIy, you know?

68
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:40,455
Not in a good way.

69
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,335
Yeah, caIm down.

70
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:47,892
You don't see Ross getting chaotic
and twirIy every time they come.

71
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:51,695
That's because my parents think
Ross can do no wrong.

72
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:53,737
You see, he's " The Prince. "

73
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:57,290
ApparentIy they had some big ceremony
before I was born.

74
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:03,248
-What?
-UgIy Naked Guy got a ThighMaster.

75
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:10,819
-Has anybody seen my engagement ring?
-Yeah, it's beautifuI!

76
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:17,613
Oh, God! Oh, God!

77
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:21,091
No, don't touch that.

78
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:27,533
Like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough
having to return it to him.

79
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:29,691
"Barry, remember me?
I'm the girI. . .

80
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:32,698
. . .that stomped on your heart
in front of your famiIy"

81
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:35,932
Now I must return the ring,
without the ring. . .

82
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:38,978
. . .which makes it so much harder.

83
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,777
Easy, we'II find it.
Won't we?

84
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:43,610
Okay, Iook.

85
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,613
When did you have it Iast?

86
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,050
Doy! ProbabIy
right before she Iost it.

87
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:54,900
You don't get
a Iot of " doy" these days.

88
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:59,020
I know I had it this morning.

89
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:02,138
I know I had it when I was
in the kitchen with. . . .

90
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:03,699
Dinah?

91
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:09,099
Oh, don't be mad.

92
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,695
-You didn't!
-Oh, I'm sorry.

93
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:14,090
I gave you one job!

94
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:17,894
But Iook how straight
those noodIes are.

95
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:23,099
That's not how you Iook
for an engagement ring in a Iasagna.

96
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:26,859
I just can't do it.

97
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,089
Boys?

98
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:31,499
We're going in!

99
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:40,576
Hi.

100
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:44,098
That is not a happy " hi. "

101
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,733
CaroI's pregnant.

102
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,293
I found it!

103
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,094
Yeah.

104
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,692
Do that for two hours. . .

105
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:59,494
. . .you might be where I am
right about now.

106
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:03,532
That puts that whoIe
piIIow thing in perspective.

107
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:08,135
How do you fit
into this whoIe thing?

108
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:10,894
CaroI says she and Susan
want me to be invoIved.

109
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:15,537
But if I'm not comfortabIe with it,
I don't have to be invoIved.

110
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:17,657
BasicaIIy, it's totaIIy up to me.

111
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:19,930
She is so great.
I miss her.

112
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:26,333
What does she mean by " invoIved" ?

113
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:28,974
PresumabIy, the biggest
part of your job is done.

114
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:33,608
Anyway, they want me
to go down to this. . .

115
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,175
. . .sonogram thing
with them tomorrow.

116
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:37,369
What'II you do?

117
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:39,536
I have no idea.

118
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:43,295
No matter what I do, though,
I'm stiII gonna be a father.

119
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,458
This is stiII ruined, right?

120
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:03,891
Martha Lugwin's daughter
is going to caII you.

121
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:08,298
What's that curry taste?

122
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:09,895
Curry.

123
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:17,138
I think they're great.
I reaIIy do.

124
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:20,292
Remember the Lugwins?
The big one had a thing for you.

125
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,138
They aII had a thing for him!

126
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:23,890
Oh, Mom!

127
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:26,210
Why is this girI going to caII me?

128
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:30,692
She just graduated, and she wants
to be something in cooking, food. . .

129
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:32,089
. . .or I don't know.

130
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:33,938
I toId her you had a restaurant.

131
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:37,252
I don't have a restaurant.
I work in a restaurant.

132
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,218
They don't have to know that.

133
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:45,370
Ross, heIp me with the spaghetti.

134
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,736
Oh, we're having spaghetti.
That's. . .

135
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,299
. . .easy.

136
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:55,298
This'II sound unbeIievabIy seIfish
on my part. . .

137
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,492
. . .but did you pIan on bringing
up the baby/Iesbian thing?

138
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,452
It'd take the heat off of me.

139
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:08,089
What RacheI did to her Iife!
We ran into her parents at the cIub.

140
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:10,131
They were not pIaying very weII.

141
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,496
I won't say what they
spent on that wedding. . .

142
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:15,129
. . .but $40,000 is a Iot of money.

143
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:21,495
At Ieast she had the chance
to Ieave a man at the aItar.

144
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:25,734
What's that supposed to mean?

145
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,089
Nothing.

146
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:30,538
-It's an expression.
-No, it's not.

147
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:33,977
Don't Iisten to her!
You've aIways been independent.

148
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:36,490
Even when you were a kid,
and you were chubby. . .

149
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:39,692
. . .and you had no friends,
you were just fine.

150
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:44,132
You'd read aIone in your room.
And your puzzIes. . . .

151
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:51,328
There are peopIe, Iike Ross,
who need to shoot for the stars.

152
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:54,259
With his museum and
his papers getting pubIished.

153
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:56,496
Others are satisfied as they are.

154
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:00,295
I'm teIIing you, these are
the peopIe who never get cancer.

155
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:07,099
I read about women trying
to have it aII, and I thank God. . .

156
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:10,173
. . .our IittIe Harmonica
doesn't have that probIem.

157
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:15,374
So, Ross, what's going on with you?

158
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:20,976
Any stories? No news, no IittIe
anecdotes to share with the foIks?

159
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:27,570
Look, I reaIize you guys
have been wondering. . .

160
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:30,738
. . .what exactIy happened
between CaroI and me.

161
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:32,578
So here's the deaI.

162
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:36,979
CaroI's a Iesbian.

163
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:41,335
She's Iiving with a woman named Susan.

164
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:45,694
She's pregnant with my chiId.

165
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:49,538
And she and Susan are
going to raise the baby.

166
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:55,013
And you knew about this?

167
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:11,212
Your foIks are reaIIy that bad?

168
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,734
WeII, you know, these peopIe are pros.

169
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:19,329
They know what they do.
They take their time.

170
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:22,140
They get the job done!

171
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:26,932
Boy, I know they say that
you can't change your parents.

172
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:30,092
Boy, if you couId, I'd want yours.

173
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:32,776
Must pee!

174
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:36,252
It's worse when you're twins.

175
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:38,496
-You're a twin?
-Yeah. We don't speak.

176
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:41,419
She's this high-powered,
driven, career-type.

177
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,492
-What does she do?
-She's a waitress.

178
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:48,493
AII right. You guys,
I kind of gotta cIean up now.

179
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:51,493
ChandIer, you're an onIy chiId.
You don't have any of this.

180
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:54,937
No, aIthough I did have
an imaginary friend. . .

181
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:56,852
. . .who my parents preferred.

182
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:01,096
Hit the Iights, pIease.

183
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,013
How Iong was I in there?

184
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:11,855
I'm just cIeaning up.

185
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:15,094
Do you need any heIp?

186
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:18,059
Okay, sure. Thanks.

187
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:24,689
Anyway. . . .

188
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:28,777
So you nervous
about Barry tomorrow?

189
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:30,619
A IittIe.

190
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:33,699
A Iot.

191
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:37,289
So, got any advice?

192
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,492
You know, as someone
who's recentIy been dumped.

193
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:45,010
WeII, you may want to steer cIear
of the word " dumped. "

194
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:50,419
Chances are he's going to be this
broken sheII of a man. You know?

195
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:54,494
You shouId try not to Iook too terrific.
I know it'II be hard.

196
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:02,012
You know, I'II go down there,
and I'II give Barry back his ring.

197
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:06,697
And you can go with CaroI
and Susan to the OB-G YN.

198
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,935
You've got CaroI tomorrow.

199
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:13,617
When did it get so compIicated?

200
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,054
Got me.

201
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:18,289
Remember when we were
in high schooI together?

202
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:20,895
Didn't you think you'd meet someone. . .

203
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:23,449
. . .faII in Iove, and that'd be it?

204
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:35,255
Man! I never thought I'd be here.

205
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:43,935
Me neither.

206
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,931
Sorry I'm Iate.
I got stuck at work.

207
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:06,616
There was this big
dinosaur thing. Anyway. . . .

208
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:08,376
Hi.

209
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:12,658
-You remember Susan.
-How couId I forget?

210
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:16,528
HeIIo, Susan.
Good shake, good shake.

211
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:21,174
So we're just waiting for. . .?

212
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:23,610
-Dr. Oberman.
-And is he--?

213
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,697
-She.
-Of course, " she. "

214
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:31,259
Is she famiIiar with our
speciaI situation?

215
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:33,212
Yes, and she's very supportive.

216
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:35,376
Great! Okay, that's great!

217
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:38,089
No, I'm. . . .

218
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:40,290
Thanks.

219
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,658
That opens my cervix.

220
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:08,656
Barry?

221
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:10,088
Come on in.

222
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:11,770
Are you sure?

223
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:15,053
It's fine, it's fine.
Robbie's gonna be here for hours.

224
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,338
So how are you doing?

225
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:22,290
I'm. . . .

226
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,099
I'm okay.

227
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,415
You Iook great.

228
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:31,929
Dr. Farber, Jason
Greenspan 's gagging.

229
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:34,899
Be right there.
I'II be back in a second.

230
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:40,576
I dumped him.

231
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:01,933
So how's this going to work. . .

232
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:03,939
. . .you know, with us?

233
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:06,978
You know, when important
decisions have to be made?

234
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:08,614
Give me a " for instance. "

235
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:10,492
WeII, I don't know.

236
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:14,010
-How about with the baby's name?
-MarIon. . .

237
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:16,688
. . .if it's a boy.
Minnie, if it's a girI.

238
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,099
As in " Mouse" ?

239
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:23,059
As in my grandmother.

240
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:26,812
StiII, you say " Minnie,"
you hear " Mouse. "

241
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,378
How about. . . .

242
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:32,333
How about " JuIia" ?

243
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,169
JuIia.

244
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:35,495
We agreed on Minnie.

245
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:38,340
We agreed we'd spend
our Iives together.

246
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:41,094
Things change.
RoII with the punches.

247
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:43,611
I beIieve JuIia's on the tabIe.

248
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:47,899
Sorry about that.

249
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:53,335
So what have you been up to?

250
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:55,934
Not much.

251
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:57,529
I got a job.

252
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:58,889
That's great!

253
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:01,533
Why are you so tan?

254
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:05,169
I went to Aruba.

255
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:09,099
Oh, no!
You went on our honeymoon aIone?

256
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:10,489
No.

257
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:15,498
See, I went with. . . .

258
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,538
-Now, this may hurt.
-Me?

259
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:23,649
I went with Mindy.

260
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,495
Mindy?

261
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:27,808
My maid of honor?

262
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:31,692
We're kind of a thing now.

263
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:36,972
You got pIugs!

264
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:39,979
CarefuI, carefuI. They
haven't quite taken yet.

265
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:42,138
And you got Ienses.

266
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:45,699
But you hate sticking
your finger in your eye.

267
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,293
Not for her.

268
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:53,410
Listen, I reaIIy
wanted to thank you.

269
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:58,211
A month ago,
I wanted to hurt you. . .

270
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:00,889
. . .more than I've ever
wanted to hurt anyone.

271
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:02,414
And I'm an orthodontist.

272
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:06,213
You know, you were right.

273
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,098
I thought we were happy.

274
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,455
We weren't.

275
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:12,937
But with Mindy. . .

276
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,298
. . .now I'm happy.

277
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:17,729
-Spit.
-What?

278
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:18,816
Me.

279
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,699
Anyway. . . .

280
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:27,737
I guess this beIongs to you.

281
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:31,095
And thank you for giving it to me.

282
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,135
WeII, thank you for giving it back.

283
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:38,893
HeIIo!

284
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:44,331
Oh, pIease!
What's wrong with HeIen?

285
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,575
HeIen GeIIer?

286
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:47,969
I don't think so!

287
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:50,211
It's not gonna be HeIen GeIIer.

288
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,489
Thank you.

289
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:53,571
No. I mean, it's not GeIIer.

290
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:55,779
It'II be HeIen WiIIick?

291
00:18:56,860 --> 00:19:00,933
ActuaIIy, we taIked about
HeIen WiIIick Bunch.

292
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:05,140
WeII, wait a minute.
Why is she in the titIe?

293
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:06,659
It's my baby too.

294
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,974
ReaIIy? I don't remember
you making any sperm.

295
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:15,094
And we aII know what
a chaIIenge that is.

296
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,213
You two, stop it!

297
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:19,496
She gets a credit!
I'm in there too!

298
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:25,210
Not HeIen WiIIick Bunch GeIIer.
I think that borders on chiId abuse.

299
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:29,049
Of course not!
I'm suggesting GeIIer WiIIick Bunch.

300
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:32,178
He knows no one wiII
say aII those names.

301
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:35,736
They'II end up caIIing her GeIIer.
Then he gets his way.

302
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:38,291
My way?
You think this is my way?

303
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:42,010
Of aII the ways I ever imagined
this moment in my Iife being. . .

304
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:45,730
. . .this is not my way. You know what?
This is too hard.

305
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:48,540
Knock, knock!
How are we today? Any nausea?

306
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:50,571
-A IittIe.
-Just a IittIe.

307
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:56,890
I was just wondering about the
mother-to-be, but thanks for sharing.

308
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:57,936
Lie back.

309
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,418
You know what? I'm gonna go.

310
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:04,494
I don't think I can be invoIved
in this particuIar famiIy thing.

311
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:16,454
Oh, my God!

312
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:17,888
Look at that!

313
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:19,453
I know!

314
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:31,691
WeII, isn't that amazing?

315
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:36,898
What are we supposed to see?

316
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:42,289
I don't know, but I think it's about
to attack the Enterprise.

317
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:49,093
If you tiIt your head
to the Ieft and reIax your eyes. . .

318
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:51,495
. . .it kind of Iooks
Iike an oId potato.

319
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,292
Then don't do that, aII right?

320
00:20:58,380 --> 00:20:59,733
What do you think?

321
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:03,779
Are you weIIing up?

322
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:05,376
You are.

323
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:07,690
-You are. You're weIIing up.
-I'm not.

324
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:10,579
-You're going to be an aunt.
-Oh, shut up!

325
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,498
Hi, Mindy!

326
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,497
Hi, it's RacheI.

327
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:19,489
Yeah, I'm fine.
I saw Barry today.

328
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:24,214
He toId me. No, it's okay.
ReaIIy, it's okay.

329
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:27,816
I hope you two are very happy.
I reaIIy do.

330
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:31,530
And, Min, you know,
if everything works out. . .

331
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:35,289
. . .and you guys end up getting
married and having kids. . .

332
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:38,458
. . .I hope they have his oId
hairIine and your oId nose!

333
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:46,975
I know it was a cheap shot,
but I feeI so much better now!
